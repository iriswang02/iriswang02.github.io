# Predictive Maintenance



#### Industrial IoT

IIoT bridges the gap between legacy industrial equipment and infrastructure and new technologies, such as machine learning, cloud, mobile, and edge computing.

**Uses Cases**

<u>Predictive quality analytics</u>

Predictive quality analytics extracts actionable insights from industrial data sources.

The goal of predictive quality analytics is to determine actions, such as adjusting machine settings. 

<u>Predictive maintenance analytics</u>

Predictive maintenance analytics captures the state of industrial equipment so that you can identify potential breakdowns before they impact production.

<u>Asset condition monitoring</u>

Asset condition monitoring captures the state of your machines and equipment so that you can understand how the asset is performing in the field or on the factory floor.

**Benefits**

<u>Take intelligent actions</u>

prebuilt machine learning models against the processed data

<u>Quickly onboard your fleet</u>

capabilities for getting large and diverse fleets of devices quickly connected

<u>Minimize production downtime</u>

devices send data to the cloud for additional processing and analytics

<u>Keep data and devices secure</u>

built-in device authentication and authorization, data encryption, and access control to device data

#### Predictive maintenance

Predictive maintenance is the practice of evaluating the condition of equipment by performing periodic (offline) or continuous (online) equipment condition monitoring. The goal of this approach is to perform maintenance at a scheduled point in time when the maintenance activity is most cost-effective, and before the equipment reduces performance within a given threshold. 

Predictive maintenance predicts failure before operations are impacted.
