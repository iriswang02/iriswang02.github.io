# In-Loop Deblocking Filter

The filter reduces blockiness while basically retaining the sharpness of the true edges in the scene. The filter typically reduces bitrate by 5%-10% for the same objective quality as the non-filtered video, and improves subjective quality even more.



Block edges are typically predicted by MCP with less accuracy than interior samples, and block transforms also produce block edge discontinuities.
