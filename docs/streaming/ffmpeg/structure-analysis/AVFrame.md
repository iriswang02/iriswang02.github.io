# AVFrame

##### Introduction:

This structure describes decoded (raw) audio or video data.

- video data: YUV, RGB...

- audio data: PCM...

It also includes some necessary information, such as

- `format`: Value correspond to `enum AVPixelFormat`

- `AVPictureType pict_type`: I, P, B ... 

- `sample_aspect_ratio`: `AVRational`

- `coded_picture_number`,

- `display_picture_number`,

- `*qscale_table`:  used by `current_picture.qscale_table[mb_pos]`

  Each mb has one QP value.

  ```c
   int mb_pos = s->mb_x + s->mb_y * s->mb_stride; 
  /* 
  * mb_y is the number of rows, 
  * mb_x is the number of columns, 
  * mb_stride is the number of mb in one row.
  */
  ```

- `interlaced_frame`,

- ...
